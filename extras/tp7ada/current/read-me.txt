		TURBO PASCAL UNITS IN ADA


I Introduction

   GTKAda bindings facilitate graphic programming in Ada.
And also ease translation of Pascal applications into Ada
language.

   For those who want to translate a Pascal language application
from Turbo Pascal, I provide some bindings of Turbo Pascal 7.0 units.

   This package is a very first version of TP7 units based on GTKAda
bindings.

In the package you will find a test example.


II How to use this package

   GNAT compiler and GTKAda library must be installed before,
see on Blady web site.
   Your Ada program translated from Turbo Pascal (P2Ada is recommended)
must be referenced in main.adb source with TP7.Init subprogram.
   Executable is built and run with following instructions for example:

$ gnatmake main `gtkada-config`
$ ./main

  The program is composed of a control window : start and stop execution
of your program with a Debug option, a text window if TP7.CRT is used,
a graphic window if TP7.Graph is used.

   This library is provide only for test, as it is.
It is not aimed to build any software other than for test.
